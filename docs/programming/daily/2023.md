### 「10」 I Love pointer

What is the output of the following program on a 64-bit system?

```c
    char str[3][10]={"","ILoveCKC","ILoveZJU"};
    printf("%lu#%lu\n",strlen(str[0]),sizeof(str[0]));
    printf("%lu#%lu\n",strlen(str),sizeof(str));
    printf("%d#%c\n",str[1][-10],str[1][10]); // Don't write this in your own code.
    printf("%s\n",(**str == (*(str + 1) + 8)[1] ? "True" : "False"));
    printf("%s",&str[1][9] == &((*(str + 1) + 8)[1]) ? "True" : "False");
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    ```bash
        0#10
        0#30
        0#I
        True
        True
    ```

    1. `strlen(str[0])` returns the length of the string pointed to by `str[0]`, which is 0. `sizeof(str[0])` returns the size of the array `str[0]`, which is 10.
    2. `strlen(str)` returns the length of the string pointed to by `str`, which is 0. `sizeof(str)` returns the size of the array `str`, which is 30. In fact, `str[0]`'s value is same as `str`'s value.
    3. `str[1][-10]` is equivalent to `*(str[1] - 10)` which is equivalent to `**(str + 1 * 10 - 10)` which is equivalent to `** str`. So `str[1][-10]`'s value is `'\0'`. `str[1][10]` is equivalent to `*(str[1] + 10)` which is equivalent to `**(str + 1 * 10 + 10)` which is equivalent to `** (str + 20)` So `str[1][10]`'s value is `'I'`.
    4. `(*(str + 1) + 8)[1]` is the same as `str[1][9]`. So `**str == (*(str + 1) + 8)[1]` is true.

### 「9」 `sizeof` All in One

What is the output of the following program on a 64-bit system?

```C
char str[][3] = {'L', 'o', 'v', 'e', 'C', 'K', 'C'};
printf("%d ", (int)sizeof(str));
printf("%d ", (int)sizeof(&str));
printf("%d ", (int)sizeof(*str));
printf("%d ", (int)sizeof(str + 1));
printf("%d ", (int)sizeof(*str + 1));
printf("%d ", (int)sizeof(*(str + 1)));
printf("%d", (int)sizeof(*(*(str + 1) + 1)));
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    `9 8 3 8 8 3 1 `.
    
    This is a comprehensive problem combining `sizeof` and pointer.

    1. When the object is an array name, the return value is the total size of the whole array. At initialization, the third row of the array will be filled to a 1-D array of length 3 automatically: `char str[][3] = {{'L', 'o', 'v'}, {'e', 'C', 'K'}, {'C', '\0', '\0'}};`. Therefore the value of `sizeof(str)` equals to 3 * 3 * 1 = 9 since `sizeof(char) = 3`.
    2. In the expression `&str`, `&` represents the address-of operator and the return value is the address of the entire array. That, of course, can be regarded as a pointer and hence `sizeof(&str)` equals 8 (Bytes), the size of a pointer on a 64-bit system.
    3. Now let's focus on `str`. We know that `str` is an array of `char [3]`. In the view of pointer, `str` is also a pointer to the first element (Note that the **element** here is an array of  length 3). Hence `*str` is equivalent to `str[0]` which is an 1D array of length 3. So the output of `sizeof(*str)` is 3 * 1 = 3.
    4. In the previous discussion we know that `str` is a pointer to array of length 3 (`char (*)[3]` actually), so `str + 1` is also a pointer and the output is 8.
    5. `*str` (equivalent to `str[0]`), will be converted to `int *` when added by 1. Therefore `*str + 1` is a pointer to `str[0][1]` and 8 will be output again.
    6. From discussion 3 and 4 it's not difficult to find `*(str + 1)` an array of length 3 (`str[1]`), so 3 is the answer.
    7. `*(*(str + 1) + 1)` is classical equivalence of `str[1][1]`. Therefore `sizeof(*(*(str + 1) + 1))` equals to `sizeof(char)`, namely 1.

### 「8」 J lost

Given the following program:

```c linenums="1" hl_lines="7 13"
void xqc(char c[], int i);

int main(void) {
    char c[] = "I am a Man of Fortune";
    char d[] = "and I must seek my Fortune";

    xqc(c + 1, ~1694);
    xqc(d - ~3, -65);
    printf("%s, %s\n", c, d);
}

void xqc(char c[], int i) {
    c = c - 1;
    c[0] = ' ';
    c[1] = (i & 1) + 'I';
}
```

Which of the following is correct?

A. This program fails to compile, because you cannot assign to an array in line 13.

B. Because of the call-by-value, function `xqc` cannot modify the character arrays in function `main`.

C. Change `1694` in line 7 to `1994`, and the result of the program is the same.

D. This program outputs `I am a Man of Fortune, and J must seek my Fortune`.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    C.

    A: Inside function `xqc`, `c` is a pointer type `char *` rather than an array type, because when an array type is used in a function parameter list, it actually is the corresponding pointer type. Therefore, the assignment in line 13 is valid, and it means "to move the pointer `c` one position backward".

    B: The function `xqc` can modify the character arrays in function `main`, because it takes the address of the character arrays as parameters. The function `xqc` can modify the contents of the character arrays through the pointers.

    C: The `~` operator is the bitwise NOT operator. The `~1694` is equivalent to `-1695`. The `~3` is equivalent to `-4`. Therefore, the calls to function `xqc` are equivalent to:

    ```c
    xqc(c + 1, -1695);
    xqc(d - -4, -65);
    ```

    And `i & 1` gets the last bit of `i`. Both `-1695` and `-65` are odd numbers, so `i & 1` is `1`, and the character `1 + 'I'`, which is `'J'`, is assigned. Changing `1694` to `1994` does not change the result of the program, because `~1994` is `-1995`, and `-1995` is also an odd number.

    D: This program outputs <code>&nbsp;Jam a Man of Fortune, and J must seek my Fortune</code>.

    !!! tip

        You don't need to calculate the exact value of `~1694`. All you need to know is that the last bit of `1694` is 0 (since it is an even number), and the bitwise NOT operator will reverse that last bit. Therefore, `~1694` is an odd number, and `i & 1` is `1`. Ditto for `~1994`.

### 「7」 The difference between `strlen` and `sizeof`.

```c linenums="1"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
	char arr1[] = "abcd";
	char arr2[] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};
	printf("%d\n", sizeof(arr1));
	printf("%d\n", sizeof(arr2));
	printf("%d\n", strlen(arr1));
	printf("%d\n", strlen(arr2));
	return 0;
}
```

What are the results?

<div style="display: flex">
    <div style="width: 100%">A. 4, 4, 4, 4</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">B. 5, 4, 4, 4</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">C. 4, 4, 4, indeterminable</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">D. 5, 4, 4, indeterminable</div>
</div>

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    D.

    `arr1` has `\0` at the end, but `arr2` doesn't.

    The `sizeof` operator returns the size of its operand in bytes. In this case, the size of `arr1` is 5, because it contains 4 characters and a null character `\0`. The size of `arr2` is 4, because it contains just 4 characters. The `\0` is absent in `arr2`.

    The `strlen` function returns the length of the string, that is, the number of characters in the string before the null character `\0`. In this case, the length of `arr1` is 4, because it contains 4 characters before the null character `\0`. But the length of `arr2` is indeterminable, because it does not contain a null character `\0`. The `strlen` function will continue to read memory until it finds a null character `\0`, resulting totally random result. If there is no null character `\0` in the memory, the behavior is undefined.

### 「6」 Stack and Queue (adapted from FDS mid-term exam)

Given an empty stack `S` and an empty queue `Q`. Push elements `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}` one by one onto `S`. If each element that is popped from `S` is enqueued onto `Q` immediately, and if the dequeue sequence is `{3, 2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 1}`, then the minimum size of `S` should be:

<div style="display: flex">
    <div style="width: 100%">A. 5</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">B. 4</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">C. 3</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">D. 7</div>
</div>

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    C.

    Stack is LIFO (Last In, First Out), queue is FIFO (First In, First Out). So dequeue sequence of queue is also the enqueue sequence. If enqueue sequence of Q is {3, 2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 1}, all operation of stack S must be the following:

    -   Push 1 and 2 and 3 into stack sequentially. Stack S now contains 3 nodes.
    -   Pop 3, stack contains 2 nodes
    -   Pop 2, stack contains 1 node
    -   Push 4, stack contains 2 nodes
    -   Pop 4, stack contains 1 node
    -   Push 5, stack contains 2 nodes
    -   Push 6, stack contains 3 nodes
    -   Pop 6, stack contains 2 nodes
    -   Push 7, stack contains 3 nodes
    -   Pop 7, stack contains 2 nodes
    -   Pop 5, stack contains 1 node
    -   Pop 1, stack is empty

    In the process, there are at most 3 nodes in stack S, so the minimum size of S should be 3.

### 「5」 Monotonic stacks

Monotonic stacks are a specialized version of the standard stack data structure, designed to maintain elements in a pre-defined sorted order. Unlike regular stacks, which allow push and pop operations without any constraints, monotonic stacks enforce an order - either increasing or decreasing - on the elements. This means that elements are either **strictly** increasing or **strictly** decreasing from the top to the bottom of the stack.

The core operations of a monotonic stack, namely `push`, are modified to maintain the stack’s order. During a `push` operation, elements that break the monotonic property are removed from the stack before the new element is added.

For example, now we have a decreasing monotonic stack, where elements closer to the top have the **smaller** values:

```text
[5,4,2,1]
       ^
       |
       top
```

We push a data with the value $3$, and because $1,2$ is smaller than $3$, we remove them. And finally it will be:

```text
[5,4,3]
     ^
     |
     top
```

Now, your task is to create an decreasing monotonic stack in the C language.

```c linenums="1" hl_lines="12 17 20 24"
typedef struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
} Node;

typedef struct Stack {
    Node* top;
} Stack;

Stack* createStack() {
    Stack* stack = (Stack*)malloc(sizeof(Stack));
    /* (1) */;
    return stack;
}

void push(Stack* stack, int data) {
    while (/* (2) */) {
        Node* temp = stack->top;
        stack->top = temp->next;
        /* (3) */;
    }
    Node* newNode = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));
    newNode->data = data;
    /* (4) */;
    stack->top = newNode;
}

int pop(Stack* stack) {
    if (isEmpty(stack)) {
        printf("Stack is empty\n");
        return -1;
    }
    Node* temp = stack->top;
    int popped = temp->data;
    stack->top = temp->next;
    free(temp);
    return popped;
}
```

    单调栈是一种特殊的栈，其中每个元素都严格小于或大于它下面的元素。大家在后续的课程中有可能会接触到他的一些应用。接下来我们逐一看看这些题目怎么填写：

    **第一空**：这里需要初始化栈顶元素。由于栈是空的，所以栈顶应该设置为 `NULL`。

    ```c
    stack->top = NULL;
    ```

    **第二空**：这是最难的一空。根据题意，这一层循环的目的是：移除所有小于**或等于**新元素的栈顶元素，以维持栈的单调性。但是还有一种情况：如果栈本身是空的，或者所有元素都比新元素小，那必须得退出循环。

    ```c
    while (stack->top != NULL && stack->top->data <= data)
    ```

    **第三空**：不大容易想到。在移除栈顶元素后，应该释放该节点占用的内存。

    ```c
    free(temp);
    ```

    > 为什么出这个？因为 wk 明确说过，考试考这个填空，不写 free 就少 2 分，所以出了这个空来让大家注意。

    **第四空**：这里需要将新节点的 `next` 指针指向之前的栈顶元素，然后将栈顶指针指向新节点，这样新节点就成为了新的栈顶。

    ```c
    newNode->next = stack->top;
    ```

### 「4」 Command Line Arguments

If you run the following command in the terminal:

```text linenums="1"
./a.out this is a test
```

Please describe what will the program see in `argv` and `argc`.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    `argv` is an array of pointers to strings, and `argc` is the number of strings in `argv`. The `argv` array contains the following strings:

    ```text
    argv[0] = "./a.out"
    argv[1] = "this"
    argv[2] = "is"
    argv[3] = "a"
    argv[4] = "test"
    ```

    The `argc` is 5, because there are 5 strings in `argv`.

    The `argv` array is terminated by a null pointer, so `argv[5]` is a null pointer.

### 「3」 `sizeof` `struct`

Consider the following code fragment:

```c linenums="1"
struct A {
    char a[10];
    int b;

};
typedef struct A A;

struct B {
    char *a;
    int b;
};
typedef struct B* B;
```

What is the value of `sizeof(A)` and `sizeof(B)`?

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    `sizeof(A)` is 16, and `sizeof(B)` is 8 (on a 64-bit modern system).

    The `sizeof` operator returns the size of its operand in bytes. The size of a structure type is as large as the sum of the sizes of its members.

    You may think the size of `A` is 14, because the size of `char[10]` is 10, and the size of `int` is 4. However, to improve performance of memory access, C standard allows the compiler to add padding bytes after each member of a structure, and the padding strategy is **implementation specific**. A common strategy is to align each member to the size of its type, that is to say, make their memory address to be a multiple of the size of the member. For example, on a 64-bit system, the address of a 4-byte integer must be a multiple of 4.

    Therefore, The size of `A` is 16. The compiler will add 2 padding bytes after `char[10]`, to make the address of `int` a multiple of 4 in `struct A`.

    The size of `B` is 8, because `B` is a pointer and the size of pointer is 8. The size of type to which `B` points does not affect the size of `B`. Notice that type `B` is not equivalent to type `struct B`.

    For more information about `sizeof` operator, see [cppreference-sizeof](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/sizeof).

### 「2」 Print Non-printable Characters

Write a program to convert unprintable characters (characters with ASCII codes between `0x00`~`0x1f` and `0x7f`) in the input string to hexadecimal format for output.

Requirements:

-   Do not use the `printf` series of formatting output functions.
-   The minimum field width for output is `2`, and if the hexadecimal number is less than 2 digits, pad it with leading zeros. For example, `0x0a`.

Sample Input：

```text
Hello
World!
```

Sample Output：

```text
Hello\0x0aWorld!
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    ```c linenums="1"
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <ctype.h>

    const char* hex_digits = "0123456789abcdef";

    int main(void) {
        char temp;
        while((temp = getchar()) != EOF) {
            if (isprint(temp)) {
                putchar(temp);
            } else {
                putchar('\\');
                putchar('0');
                putchar('x');
                putchar(hex_digits[temp >> 4]);
                putchar(hex_digits[temp & 0xf]);
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    If you are not familiar with bitwise operations, the 14th and 15th lines in the above code fragment can be written in a more understandable form:

    ```c
    putchar(hex_digits[temp / 16]);
    putchar(hex_digits[temp % 16]);

### 「1」 Hello, Cat

After executing the following code fragment, the output should be **\_\_**.

{
    char s1[10] = "Hello\0Ow<";
    char s2[10] = "world";

    char *s4 = s2 + 3;
    strcat(s3, s4);
    printf("%s, %s; %s, %s.\n", s1, s2, s3, s4);
    return 0;
}
```

A. `Hello, world; llold, ld.`

B. `Hello, world; lloldw<, ld.`

C. `Hellold, world; llold, ld.`

D. `Helloldw<, world; lloldw<, ld.`

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    `C`.

    The `strcat` function appends a copy of the string pointed to by `s4` to the end of the string pointed to by `s3`. The `s3` and `s4` pointers point to the third character of `s1` and the fourth character of `s2`, respectively. Therefore, the `strcat` function appends the string `"ld"` to the end of the string `"Hellold"`, resulting in `"Helloldld"`, and the `printf` function prints `"Hellold, world; llold, ld."`.

    When the `strcat` function appends the string `"ld"` after "Hello", it overwrites the null character `'\0'` at the end of the string `"Hello"` and write a new null character `'\0'` at the end of the string `"Helloldld"`. Therefore, the character `w` and `<` after the null character `'\0'` in `s1` are not printed.

    1. `list`

    4. `node`
    5. `list->next`

    !!! note inline end ""

        ![](graph/23.11.30.drawio.svg)

    Notice this is a doubly linked list **with a dummy node**. The dummy node is a special node that does not store any data. It is used to simplify the implementation of the linked list. In this case, the dummy node is `list`.

    The `insertFront` function inserts a new node with `data` at the front of the list. The new node is inserted between the dummy node and the first node of the list. The `insertFront` function takes two steps:

    6. Create a new node and set its `data` to `data`.
    7. Insert the new node between the dummy node and the first node of the list.

    If you want to iterate over the list, you should start from the first node of the list, which is `list->next`.

### 「29」 Soyo Size

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"
    C.

    When an array type is used in a function parameter list, it is transformed to the corresponding pointer type: `int f(int a[])` and `int f(int *a)` declare the same function. See [cppreference-Array to pointer conversion](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array#Array_to_pointer_conversion) for more information.

    So the parameter `soyo` in function `print_soyo` is actually a pointer, and the size of a pointer is variable depending on the architecture. On a 64-bit machine, the size of a pointer is 8 bytes, and on a 32-bit machine, the size of a pointer is 4 bytes. Therefore, the output of this program is `8`.

### 「28」 Naughty Pointer

The following code fragment prints out **\_\_**.

```c linenums="1"
int a[2][3] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
int(*p)[3] = *a + 1;
printf("%d", *(*(p + 1) + 1));
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    `6`.

    Obviously, the type of `p` is declared as `int (*)[3]`, which is a pointer to an array of 3 integers. We know that in the initializer, `a` will be converted to a pointer to its first element, so `*a` is equivalent to `a[0]`, which is an array of 3 integers. Then, the type of `*a` will be converted from `int [3]` to `int *` again. Therefore, adding 1 to `*a` will make it point to the next integer, which is `a[0][1]`.

    You may notice that the type of `*a + 1` is not the same as pointer `p`. In fact, its type is casted to `int (*)[3]` when assigned to `p`. Trying to figure out the "meaning" of `p` now may become more difficult. Instead, just remember the value of pointer `p` is the address of `a[0][1]`.

    Now consider the expression `*(*(p + 1) + 1)`. First, since the type of `p` is `int (*)[3]`, adding 1 to `p` will make it point to the next array of 3 integers; that is to say, the value of `p` will be the address of the third integer after `a[0][1]`, which is `a[1][1]`. So `*(p + 1)` is just equivalent to `&a[1][1]`. Then, adding 1 to `*(p + 1)` will make it point to the next integer, which is `a[1][2]`. Thus, the value of `*(*(p + 1) + 1)` is `a[1][2]`, which is 6.

### 「27」 I Love `scanf`!

After entering the following inputs, does the program operate normally? If it does, what should be the output?

```c linenums="1"
int a;
char c1, c2;
char s[7];
scanf("%d%c %c%s\n", &a, &c1, &c2, s);
printf("%d#%c#%c#%s", a, c1, c2, s);
```

```bash linenums="1"
#input: there is no space after the last character
20231127
 ckc-agc
daily_problem
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    The program operates normally and the output is:

    ```text
    20231127#
    #c#kc-agc
    ```

    The `scanf` function reads input from the standard input stream, which is usually the keyboard. The format string of `scanf` is `"%d%c %c%s\n"`. The first `%d` matches the integer `20231127`, the second `%c` matches the character `'\n'` because `%c` won't miss any character including `' '` and `'\n'`. The space in formatting string will ignore every blank character, so the third `%c` matches the character `'c'`, and the fourth `%s` matches the string `"kc-agc"`, whose length is 7. When you print `\n` after line2,  `scanf` will not stop, because `'\n'` in formatting string will ignore every blank character. So until you enter a non-blank character and use enter to send it to the program from buffer, `scanf` will stop.

### 「26」 Broken `strcpy()`

Does this `strcpy()` implementation do its job?

```c linenums="1"
void my_strcpy(char *s, const char *t) {
    do {
        *s++ = *t++;
    } while (*t);
}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    No, it's broken. This implementation does not terminate the string pointed to by `s`. To correctly copy a string, the character used in assignment must be the same character used in loop condition.

    What does that mean? Suppose `t = "Hello"`, then:

    - `*t` is `'H'`, and is assigned to `*s`.
    - `s` and `t` increment.
    - `*t`, now being `'e'`, is used to evaluate the `while` condition.
    - ... this process repeats until `t` points to `'o'` and is assigned to `*s`.
    - `s` and `t` increment.
    - `*t`, now being `'\0'`, is used to evaluate the `while` condition. The loop ends.

    See the problem? The null byte `'\0'` is not copied to `s`, therefore it's left unterminated. Any attempt to use `s` as a string will result in undefined behavior.

    Worse still, what happens if `t` is an empty string i.e. `t = ""`?

    - `'\0'` is assigned to `*s`.
    - `s` and `t` increment. `t` gets past its end.
    - Now we have a memory out-of-bounds. Accessing `*t` is undefined behavior.
    - And it keeps copying garbage values until some arbitrary `'\0'`, or it goes too far and causes a segmentation fault.

}
```

B. `\n\n`

C. `\nI love cats!\n`

D. `I love cats!\nI love cats!\n`

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    `A`.

    The function `my_strcat` is supposed to concatenate `s1` and `s2` and store the result in `s3`. However, the function does not work as expected. The problem lies in the line `s3 = malloc(len1 + len2 + 1);`. The function `my_strcat` takes `s3` as a parameter, which is a pointer to a `char` array. When the function is called, the value of `s3` is copied to the function's local variable `s3`. Therefore, the `malloc` function allocates memory for the local variable `s3`, not the original `s3` in `main`. The memory allocated for the local variable `s3` is not used after the function returns, so it is a memory leak. The original `s3` in `main` is not modified, so it is still an empty string.

    You may think that the problem can be solved by simply deleting the line `s3 = malloc(len1 + len2 + 1);`. However, this will cause another problem. `s3` is initialized as an empty string, which means that it is a pointer to a `char` array with only one element, the null character `\0`. The memory allocated for `s3` is not enough to store the concatenated string. Therefore, this will cause a buffer overflow.

### 「23」 `typedef` and String

The preprocessing of this program is as follows：

```c linenums="1"
#define MAX_SIZE 10000

typedef struct Bookcase{
    char* book[10];
} *PtrToBookcase;

typedef PtrToBookcase Lib_data_base[MAX_SIZE];
```

After executing the following code fragment, the output should be **\_\_**.

```c linenums="1"
Lib_data_base library;
*(library) = (PtrToBookcase)malloc(sizeof(struct Bookcase));
(*library)->book[0] = "C Programming Book";
for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    printf("%.2s\n", library[0]->book[0] + strlen(library[0]->book[0]) - i - 1));
free(library[0]);
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    Output is:

    ```text
    k
    ok
    oo
    ```

    The address pointed to by `library[0]->book[0]` plus `(strlen(library[0]->book[0])-i-1) * sizeof(char)` will be eventually passed to `%.2s` and placed into the output stream.

    Thus, when `i=0`, `i=1`, and `i=2`, the strings passed to `%.2s` are "k\0", "ok\0", and "ook\0", respectively. Among these, the length of the third string "ook\0" exceeds 2, so only the first two characters "oo" will be output.

    This question involves multiple concepts, primarily focusing on both the proper usage of `typedef` and issues related to pointer output with `char*` in C. The analysis will be divided into two parts: `typedef` and `char*`. If you are already familiar with `typedef`, you can directly skip this section.

    ??? note "`typedef`"

        In the C language, `typedef` is used to create new names for existing data types.

        When using `typedef`, errors can occur in the specification of its usage. One common misunderstanding is to interpret `typedef (type_name) (new_name)`, which is correct only in a few cases, such as `typedef int Integer`.

        However, the correct understanding should be: if you need to redefine a type, first write the declaration statement of that type: `type variable_name`, then replace `variable_name` with the alias you want, and finally add `typedef` in front of the entire statement.

        For example, after `int array[10]`, where the type of the variable `array` is `int [10]`, you can rename `array` to the alias `IntegerList` and add `typedef` at the front, resulting in `typedef int IntegerList[10]`.

        After this, you can directly use the alias `IntegerList` to define variables of type `int [10]`, such as `IntegerList a;`, which is equivalent to decelaration: `int a[10]`.

        Returning to the question, let's analyze the two `typedef` statements in the question.

        The first one creates an alias for a structure variable. If we initially want to declare a variable of type `struct Bookcase*`, we would write it like this:

        ```c
        struct Bookcase {
            char* book[10];
        } *Bookcase1;
        ```

        Following the rules of `typedef`, replace the variable name `Bookcase1` with the alias `PtrToBookcase` and add `typedef` at the beginning of the entire statement, resulting in the form seen in the question:

        ```c
        typedef struct Bookcase {
            char* book[10];
        } *PtrToBookcase;
        ```

        This statement means giving an alias, `PtrToBookcase`, to the type `struct Bookcase*`.

        The second `typedef` is very similar to the example we mentioned earlier, `typedef int IntegerList[10];`.
        It first declares `PtrToBookcase Ptr1[MAX_SIZE]`, then replaces the variable name `Ptr1` with the alias `Lib_data_base`, and adds `typedef` at the front.
        Therefore, its meaning is to give an alias, `Lib_data_base`, to the type `PtrToBookcase [MAX_SIZE]`.
        Consequently, the subsequent `Lib_data_base library` actually creates an array of `PtrToBookcase`, named `library`, with `MAX_SIZE` elements.

    ??? note "`char*`"

        After understanding `typedef`, let's now explore the issue related to string output in this program.
        There are two potentially confusing elements in this code: `%.2s` and `library[0]->book[0]+strlen(library[0]->book[0])-i-1`.

        `%.2s` is relatively straightforward: It is used to control the output of strings. `%s` would directly output the characters stored at the memory location pointed to by a `char*` type pointer and all characters in consecutive memory until encountering the '\0' character.
        The additional `.2` in `%.2s` is used to limit the length of the output string. If the string length is less than or equal to 2, it will be output normally. If it exceeds 2, only the first two characters will be output.

        `library[0]->book[0]+strlen(library[0]->book[0])-i-1` involves operations on a `char*` type pointer.
        `library[0]->book[0]` is a `char*` type pointer. Adding `n` to it effectively shifts the pointer to a position `n * sizeof(char)` bytes forward from the current address. Subtracting `n` from it shifts the pointer to a position `n * sizeof(char)` bytes backward from the current address.

### 「29」 Precedence

The output of the following code fragment is **\_\_**.

```c linenums="1"
int x = 1, y = 2;
printf("%d\n", y << 1 - 1 > 2 || !(x++ > --y) ? x : y);
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    The answer is 2.

    Several operators appear in this problem, listed in order of operation precedence from top to bottom:

    * *Suffix increacement and decreacement:* `a++`
    * *Logical NOT:* `!`
    * *Prefix increacement and decreacement:* `--a`
    * *Subtraction:* `-`
    * *Bitwise left shift:* `<<`
    * *Comparison:* `<`, `>`
    * *Logical OR:* `||`
    * *Ternary conditional:* `a ? b : c`

    See more about operator precedence at [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence).

    Knowing this, let's break down the expression from the innermost to the outermost parts.

    1. `1 - 1` evaluates to 0, and `y << 0` has the value 2.
    2. `2 > 2` is false, thus the value of the Logical OR depends on the right part.
    3. `x++` assigns the value of `x` (1) to the expression and then increments `x` by 1, making `x` equal to 2.
    4. `--y` decreases the value of `y` (2) by 1, so `y` becomes 1.
    5. `x++ > --y` is equivalent to 1 > 1, which is false, so this part equals 0.
    6. `!(x++ > --y)` negates false, so this part equals 1, making the condition of the Ternary conditional true.
    7. Since `x` has the value of 2 and `y` has the value of 1, the output will be 2.

### 「27」 Or in `switch`

What will happen when compiling and executing the following code fragment with input `5`?

```c linenums="1"

    case 0 || 2 || 4 || 6 || 8:
        printf("even digit ");
    case 1 || 3 || 5 || 7 || 9:
        printf("odd digit ");
    default:
        printf("not a digit ");
}
```

A. It will print `odd digit `.

B. It will print `odd digit not a digit`.

C. It will print `not a digit`.

D. It cannot be compiled.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    `D`.

    The compiler will tell you that `case label value has already appeared in this switch`.
    There are many problems in this code fragment, and the most important one is that `0 || 2 || 4 || 6 || 8` will not behave as expected in `case` statement. It will be evaluated as `1` because `0 || 2 || 4 || 6 || 8` is equivalent to `((((0 || 2) || 4) || 6) || 8)`. The result of `0 || 2` is `1`, so the result of `0 || 2 || 4` is `1`, and so on. Therefore, the `case` statement will be evaluated as `case 1`. The same problem exists in `case 1 || 3 || 5 || 7 || 9`, which will also be evaluated as `case 1`.
    The correct way to write this code fragment is:

    ```c
    char ch;
    scanf("%c", &ch);
    switch (ch) {
        case '0': case '2': case '4': case '6': case '8':
            printf("even digit "); break;
        case '1': case '3': case '5': case '7': case '9':
            printf("odd digit "); break;
        default:
            printf("not a digit ");
    }
    ```

### 「25」 Eternal Binary-Search

After executing the following code fragment, the output should be **\_\_**.

while (l < r){
    int mid = (l + r) / 2;
    if (ok[mid]) l = mid;
    else r = mid - 1;
}
printf ("the ok_maximum is %d", l);
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    In fact, this code fragment has no output because it is stuck in an endless loop. Let's see what happens: At first the code executes perfectly, `l` increasing and `r` decreasing constantly. However, when the value of `r-l` reduce to `1`, the value of `l` and `r` will never change again. That's because `mid` equals to `l` and `ok[mid]` is `true` (Think about it. why?), so `l = mid` will be execute, again and again with no value change.

    Binary Search is a very simple, common and useful algorithm that you will learn soon. However, when using Binary Search, it is easy to write a wrong code. It is said that only 10% of the programmers can write a exactly correct code. Hence, you need to pay special attention to this algorithm. A small change can possibly change the code correctness. For example, modifying the `int mid = (l + r) / 2;` to `int mid = (l + r + 1) / 2;` makes the code correct.

### 「24」 Nested `switch`, Confusing `default` and `break`

After executing the following code fragment, the output should be **\_\_**.

    default:
        printf("five ");
}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    `one two four`

    The syntax of `switch` statement is:

    ```c
    switch (expression) {
        case constant-expression:
            statements
        case constant-expression:
            statements
        default:
            statements
    }
    ```

    The `expression` must have an integral or enumerated type, or be of a class type in which the class has a single conversion function to an integral or enumerated type. The `constant-expression` for each `case` must be a constant expression of the same type as the expression, and no two of the constant expressions associated with the same `switch` statement shall have the same value after conversion.

    The `switch` statement evaluates `expression`, then looks for the `case` constant-expression whose value is equal to the value of `expression` (after conversion). If such a `case` is found, the statements following that `case` are executed **until a `break` statement is encountered**. If no `case` is found whose value is equal to the value of the expression, and if there is a `default` label, the statements following the `default` label are executed. Otherwise, the statements of the `switch` statement are skipped.

    If some `case` labels are not followed by `break` statements, the execution of the `switch` statement falls through to the next `case` label. You can use this behavior to execute multiple statements for a particular `case` label or to execute statements for more than one `case` label.

    1. The result of the increment and decrement operators

        Increment and decrement operators have postfix form `x++` (or `x--`), and prefix form `++x` (or `--x`).

        * The result of the postfix forms is the value of `x`.
        * The result of the prefix forms is the value of `x + 1` for `++x` (or `x - 1` for `--x`).

        For more information, see [cppreference-Increment/decrement operators](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_incdec)

    2. Logical OR `||`

        The logical OR expression has the form `lhs || rhs`, in which `rhs` is only evaluated if `lhs` compares equal to `​0`​.

        For more information, see [cppreference-Logical operators](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_logical)

    When `x < 9`, each loop will cause `x` to increase by `1`. Note that only `x-- < 9` is evaluated in each loop now.

    Now `x` is equal to `9` before the cond-expression of the for loop. First, `x-- < 9` is evaluated, which compares equal to `0`, and causes `x` to decrease by `1`. Then `x` is equal to `8` and `++x < 10` is evaluated, which compares equal to `1` and causes `x` to increase by `1`. Loop continues.

    Then, `x` is equal to `11` before the cond-expression of the for loop. Now `x-- < 9` and `++x < 10` both compare equal to `0`, so the loop ends. `x` firstly decreases by `1` and then increases by `1`, so the final value of `x` is `11`.

    Actually, the output of this program is unpredictable.

    1. To compare two strings, you should use `strcmp` function in `<string.h>` header file. Learn how to use the function by yourself.
    2. In the code snippet above, `a`, `b` and `c` are all arrays of `char`, so `a > b` and `a > c` are actually comparing the addresses of these arrays. You may think that the array declared later has a larger address, but this is not always true. It depends on the design of the architecture that the stack grows towards higher memory addresses or towards lower memory addresses. So the output of this program is unpredictable.

??? note "Answer"

    `Not equal.`

    In C (and many other programming languages), [floating-point](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B5%AE%E7%82%B9%E6%95%B0) arithmetic is not always exact due to the way numbers are represented in binary. This means that sometimes, tiny errors can be introduced and accumulated when performing mathematical operations on floating-point numbers.

    In this case, when adding 0.1 and 0.2 together, the result is not precisely 0.3 due to these inaccuracies. Thus, directly comparing floating-point numbers with `==` can lead to unexpected results.

    To deal with such issues in real programs, check if the difference between two floating-point numbers is smaller than a tiny threshold.

### 「20」 Bad for

After executing the following code fragment, the output should be **\_\_**.

```c linenums="1"
unsigned int x , y; // 'int' occupies 4 bytes
for (x = 2, y = 1; x = y; y++)
    ;
printf("%d", x-1);
```

??? note "Answer"

    `-1`.

    Notice that the condition of `for` is `x = y`, not `x == y`. So `for` loop will terminate until `y = 0`. You should consider [overflow](https://zh.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_arithmetic#Overflows) in `unsigned int` variable.

    When we execute `++` for `unsigned int y` in `for` loop, we will get `0x111...1`($2^{32}-1$) as the max `unsigned int`, and then we will get `0x00...0` as `0` because of overflow. So `x` gets the value of `y(0)` and terminates `for`. In `printf`, `x-1` is `0x11...1`. When you use `%d` to print, it will be considered as a signed interger, so the answer is `-1`, not $2^{32}-1$.

### 「19」 IsPrime?

What's wrong with this code snippet?

```c linenums="1"
int d;
scanf("%d", &d);

// determine if d is a prime number
for (int i = 2; i <= d; i++) {
  if (d % i == 0) {
    printf("%d is a composite\n", d);
    exit(0);
  }
}
printf("%d is a prime\n", d);
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    Notice the *condition* of the `for` loop: `i <= d`, which means `i` will eventually be equal to `d`.
    Therefore `d % i == 0` evaluates to 1, reporting composite for every input greater than 1.

### 「18」 Bad `if`-`else`

After executing the following code fragment, the output is **\_\_**.

```c linenums="1"
int x = 0;
int y = -2;
if(x > 0) y = 1;
else if(x < 0) y = -1;
else if(x = 0) y = 0;
printf("%d", y);
```

<div style="display: flex">
    <div style="width: 100%">A. 1</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">B. 0</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">C. -1</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">D. -2</div>
</div>

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    `D`.

    Notice that the condition of `if` in line 5 is `x = 0`, not `x == 0`. The former means "0 is assigned to x", and then the if sentence won't be executed since it is equivalent to `if(0)`. Thus the value of `y` is its initial value, -2.

### 「17」 Character

Given: `char c = '@';`, the value of expression `'A' <= c <= 'Z'` is **\_\_**.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    `1`.

    To solve this problem you do not need to remember ASCII code. This problem is about operator precedence. The expression `'A' <= c <= 'Z'` is equivalent to `(('A' <= c) <= 'Z')`. No matter what the value of `c` is, the expression `('A' <= c)` will be evaluated to `1` or `0`, which is less than `'Z'`. Therefore, the value of the expression `'A' <= c <= 'Z'` is `1`.

    But in other problems you may need to remember some key ASCII codes:

    | Character | ASCII Code |
    | --------- | ---------- |
    | `'0'`     | `48`       |
    | `'A'`     | `65`       |
    | `'a'`     | `97`       |

    Upper case is prior to lower case. The difference between `'A'` and `'a'` is `32`. So if you want to convert a lowercase letter to uppercase, you can use `c - 32`. Or an easier way: `c - 'a' + 'A'`.

### 「16」 Overflow

For code below:

```c linenums="1"
unsigned short sht = 0;
sht--;
```

What will be the value of `sht` after the execution?

<div style="display: flex">
    <div style="width: 100%">A. -1</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">B. 65535</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">C. 32767</div>
    <div style="width: 100%">D. 65536</div>
</div>

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
??? note "Answer"

    B.

    Remember that `unsigned short` is an unsigned integer type, so it will not be negative. Instead, it will be the largest value of `unsigned short` type. The largest value of `unsigned short` type is `65535`, because `unsigned short` is 16-bit long.
